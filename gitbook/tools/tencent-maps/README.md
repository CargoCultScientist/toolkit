* **Mobile:** iOS and Android.
* **API:** An email address and possibly a credit card.&#x20;

## Limitations

Tencent Maps, while a comprehensive tool for mapping and geographic data, has several limitations that researchers should be aware of:

* **API Rate Limits**: API calls are capped at a concurrency limit: 5 times/second/interface/Key Daily and calls: 10,000 times/interface/Key. For researchers requiring high-frequency data access, this might pose a limitation (see [here](https://lbs-qq-com.translate.goog/faq/accountQuota/faqKey?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_hist=true)).
* **Access speed**: International users will experience slower access speeds or need a Chinese IP address to access certain APIs. The Chinese government's [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) slows traffic plus Baidu's servers [are hosted in China, not on a distributed content network (CDN)](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/736/why-are-sites-like-youku-and-baidu-so-slow-overseas) so the distance to the nearest server is a factor.
* **Data Availability**: Coverage is in high detail for mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, and much weaker in providing maps of other countries (see: [Wikipedia Tencent Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_Maps)).&#x20;
* **Commercial Use: licensing fees may be involved for commercial use.**
* **Language and Documentation**: The primary language (including for documentation and support) is Chinese, which may present a barrier for non-Chinese speaking researchers.
* **Geographical Restrictions**: Certain data or features might be restricted outside of China due to legal or licensing issues (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)).&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

When using Tencent Maps for research or commercial purposes, it's important to take into account several ethical considerations:

* **Accuracy**: Acknowledging the limitations in data accuracy and the potential impact this may have on research outcomes based on this data  (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)).
* **Privacy Concerns**: Like many mapping services, Tencent Maps gathers user data, which raises questions about data privacy and protection. [Worried about Huawei? Take a closer look at Tencent](https://freedomhouse.org/article/worried-about-huawei-take-closer-look-tencent).
* **Censorship and Content Control**: Being a Chinese company, Tencent Maps may adhere to government censorship laws, affecting the type of content available or omitted. More information [here](https://protonvpn.com/blog/great-firewall-china).

Researchers and professionals should ensure their use of Tencent Maps aligns with broader ical guidelines and considerations relevant to their specific field or industry.

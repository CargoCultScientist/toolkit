## Description

Tencent Maps offers a wide range of features for users who are looking to navigate or explore geographical locations. The service provides detailed maps, directions for driving, public transportation options, walking routes, and also information on traffic conditions.

### Getting coordinates

Search on this page: [https://lbs.qq.com/getPoint/](https://lbs.qq.com/getPoint/)

For background: China uses a coordinate system called GCJ-02 (colloquially known as Mars coordinates), whereas the rest of the world uses WGS-84 (Earth coordinates). Using an encryption algorithm, GCJ-02 applies random offsets to the latitude and longitude of locations. Obfuscating the geographic data is for national security purposes.

## Requirements

* **Web:** web browser.
* **Mobile:** iOS or Android.
* **API:** Email address,&#x20;

## Limitations

* **Geographical Restrictions**: Certain data or features might be [restricted outside of China](./#url) due to legal or licensing issues. To set up a QQ account for map users, a Chinese phone number is required.&#x20;
* **Data availability**: Highly-detailed maps are only available for China.&#x20;
* **Limited functionalities on web browser**: Most of the app's features, including street view, are only available on the mobile app.&#x20;
* **Language**: The mapping application, documentation and support are available in Chinese only.
* **API Rate Limits**: API calls are capped at a concurrency limit: 5 times/second/interface/Key Daily and calls: 10,000 times/interface/Key. For researchers requiring high-frequency data access, this might pose a limitation (see [here](https://lbs-qq-com.translate.goog/faq/accountQuota/faqKey?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_hist=true)).
* **Access speed**: International users will experience slower access speeds or need a Chinese IP address to access certain APIs.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Accuracy**: Acknowledging the limitations in data accuracy and the potential impact this may have on research outcomes based on this data (see: [Restrictions on geographic data in China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China)).
* **Privacy Concerns**: Like many mapping services, Tencent Maps gathers user data, which raises questions about data privacy and protection. [Worried about Huawei? Take a closer look at Tencent](https://freedomhouse.org/article/worried-about-huawei-take-closer-look-tencent).
* **Censorship and Content Control**: Being a Chinese company, Tencent Maps may adhere to government censorship laws, affecting the type of content available or omitted. More information [here](https://protonvpn.com/blog/great-firewall-china).

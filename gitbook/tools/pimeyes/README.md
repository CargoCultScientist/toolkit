## Description

Users can upload one or several pictures of a person to PimEyes and the tool conducts an AI search to find pictures of faces that look similar.

According to an [netzpolitik.org interview](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/pimeyes-ceo-the-user-is-the-stalker-not-the-search-engine/) with its CEO Giorgi Gobronidze in 2022, PimEyes had "approximately 2.1 billion faces maximum" hashed at that point in time.





can verify a person’s identity by scanning [900 million](https://web.archive.org/web/20200602210520/https://pimeyes.com/en/) images from the internet. To get started, upload a photo of the person you want to verify. Users can upload up to five photos at a time. The search will produce relevant results. If an image is of poor quality and the search fails, the edit option allows users to refine an image and repeat the search. The “Take picture” option requires access to your computer’s camera.

A "safe search" option excludes "possible adult content from results." A "deep search" [option](https://pimeyes.com/en/blog/how-to-use-pimeyes-a-brief-guide#paragraph9) that takes longer and explores more databases is available to "advanced" subscription users.

Users can adjust the period from 24 hours to one year for efficient search.  The system stores the photo for [48 hours](https://pimeyes.com/en/faq) and permanently deletes it afterward.&#x20;

The system explores publicly available sources like websites, blogs and criminal records for searches. However, it cannot search the social media platforms as these sites restrict its access, unlike [Clearview AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html), a tool that law enforcement agencies have widely used. After searching, one can remove a particular result by following the steps [here](https://pimeyes.com/en/faq).&#x20;

PimEyes is particularly useful for individuals whose photos have been posted without their content, according to its [FAQ](https://pimeyes.com/en/faq).  “PimEyes enables users to monitor their digital footprint and take proactive measures by issuing Takedown Requests to protect their privacy and security.” Users can expect the system to remove their pictures from future searches by filling the takedown [request ](https://pimeyes.com/en/opt-out-request-form)form. But it is not entirely full-proof, as the disclaimer notes: “Please, take into account that we are not liable for the origin of the photo, nor able to take it down from the website it was posted on.”

In recent years, the increased use of facial recognition tools has raised concerns about potential data and privacy abuse. However, when used responsibly, this technology is beneficial. For instance, in open source investigations, PimEyes can help identify individuals [targeted](https://gijn.org/resource/facial-recognition-made-easy/) by disinformation/misinformation.

Besides this, the first 10 searches are partially free. However, a subscription is required to access results (see the Cost section).

There is also a way around the paywall for accessing results.

## Using Google Dorks to circumvent PimEyes' paywall

Open-source investigation can be challenging when investigative tools require a subscription for access. Some tricks and techniques can help find simpler solutions. For instance, using Google Dorks can help circumvent the PimEyes' paywall.

To demonstrate this, we uploaded an image of the late [former](https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/48389-zabpic-1491300516/48389-zabpic-1491300516-400x230.webp) prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Running the image through PimEyes provided multiple results but access requires a subscription. Selecting the required result shows us Bhutto's photo alongside an incomplete link:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 11.26.41 PM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

If you need these results urgently for an investigation, this might tempt you to pay $14.99 for one-time full access. But there’s another way around it: by predicting the answer to our search query, we can get a required result without any payment.

We know this personality is well-known, so the first keyword for our search is "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto." The site name appears to be "thefrontierpos," which is incomplete. A further search shows that this site is likely a Pakistani local publication known as "The Frontier Post." Taking cues from this, we'll use a site operator, and our complete search on Google will be: "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto" site:thefrontierpost.com

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 11.41.14 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The search is a hit and here's the link to the required [result](https://thefrontierpost.com/zulfikar-ali-bhutto-an-ideology/), an exact match of the result that PimEyes yielded. This article was published two years ago, which can be checked against PimEyes date beneath the result that states "indexed on August 25, 2023", confirming our search result matches the one from the tool.

Users can design their search queries based on the photo and the site name using various Google operators.

PimEyes is known for pulling incorrect images of women from [pornographic](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/technology/pimeyes-facial-recognition-search.html) sites, which is a concern that needs to be addressed.

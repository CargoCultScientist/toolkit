## Use Cases

Bing Maps can be a valuable tool for open source researchers in various ways, such as:

* **Geolocation Verification:** Verifying the location of a photo or video shared on social media to confirm the authenticity of claims made online.
* **Investigative Reporting:** Tracking and mapping out relevant locations to a story, thereby providing readers with a clearer understanding of the spatial relationships and geographical details of the investigation. One issue to remember is that Bing map imagery may not be up to date see [How often are Bing satellite Maps updated?](https://www.studycountry.com/wiki/how-often-are-bing-satellite-maps-updated) for more information.
* **Historical Analysis:** Comparing current maps with historical data to highlight changes over time in areas of interest, which can add depth to stories on urban development, environmental changes, or socio-economic shift.
* **Infrastructure Analysis:** Analyzing satellite images and 3D maps of critical infrastructure for changes or developments that might indicate political, military, or economic events.
* **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitoring changes in landscapes, forest cover, water bodies, etc., to report on environmental issues or natural disasters.
* **Gathering Geopolitical Intelligence:** Mapping conflict zones, territorial control changes, or military movements using updated satellite imagery to understand geopolitical dynamics.

* **Mobile**: iOS and Android
* **Developer Platform:** Azure account with email address and a credit card.

## Limitations

* **Licensing and Cost**: Bing Maps API incurs costs for extensive usage beyond the provided free usage quotas, which might not be suitable for projects with limited budgets (see: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/licensing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/api-management/)).
* **Data Coverage**: While comprehensive, Bing Maps has less detailed mapping data in certain remote or less-populated regions compared to other services such as Google Maps.
* **Developer API Limits**: There are daily rate limits on API calls, which may impact large-scale applications or services requiring high numbers of requests (see: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/product/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/product/)).
* **Update Frequency**: The frequency of map updates for certain areas may not be as regular as some users require, potentially affecting the accuracy of the maps. See [How often are Bing satellite Maps ?](https://www.studycountry.com/wiki/how-often-are-bing-satellite-maps-updated) for more information.
* **Feature Set**: Although Bing Maps offers a wide range of functionalities, it lacks features found in other mapping services, such as the more advanced analytical tools and detailed terrain information found in Google Earth Pro.

## Ethical Considerations

When open source researchers use Bing Maps, they should consider the following ethical aspects:

* **Privacy and Anonymity**: Be cautious when reporting on sensitive areas or topics. Ensure individuals' locations or movements are not disclosed without consent, especially in contexts where revealing locations could endanger lives or privacy.
* **Data Accuracy and Misrepresentation**: Verify the accuracy of the information provided by Bing Maps. Misrepresenting a location, either intentionally or accidentally due to outdated or incorrect map data, can lead to misinformation and harm reputations. For more information see [Google Earth, Google satellite, and Bing aerial accuracy](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/86734/google-earth-google-satellite-and-bing-aerial-accuracy).
* **Impartiality and Bias**: Understand the limitations of Bing Maps in representing disputed territories or areas of conflict. Be aware of how the depiction of these areas might convey a particular political stance or bias, affecting the impartiality of the reportage. Examples of this can be seen in [border bias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/14/google-maps-political-borders/) and [local 'safety' bias](https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/tech-regulation/emerging-technologies/2022/08/mapping-navigational-apps-gis-safety-bias-google-maps).

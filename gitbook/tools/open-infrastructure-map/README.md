# Open Infrastructure Map

## URL

[https://openinframap.org](https://openinframap.org)

## Description

Open Infrastructure Map allows users to search for and view global infrastructure networks, to include:

* power lines, power plants, generators, power line supports, switchgear
* telecom
* gas
* petroleum
* water
* other pipelines

It presents a globe the user can turn in order to zoom in on a geographical location of interest.  On the sidebar are various types of infrastructure the user can select or deselect.  The sidebar also contains a key with icons and colored lines representing various infrastructure types, which the user can consult to identify the infrastructure being displayed. For example, an icon of a tower denotes a telecom tower; a red line represents a ≥ 220 kV powerline, and so forth.  Once the user has zoomed in sufficiently on a location — for example, a power station -- the user can click on it, which opens a mini window containing additional details about the location.&#x20;

The map also provides a selectable "nighttime lights" feature.

Because Open Infrastructure Map aids in infrastructure visibility, it could assist in pursuits as varied as researching a country's oil infrastructure (as referenced, for example, in [https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/04/15/what-oil-satellite-technology-and-iraq-can-tell-us-about-pollution/](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/04/15/what-oil-satellite-technology-and-iraq-can-tell-us-about-pollution/),  helping companies focused on energy infrastructure planning, or assisting authorities with emergency preparedness, among many other uses.

Example use case: An energy company focused on accelerating the global transition towards 100% renewable energy used Open Infrastructure Map to map and view India's power infrastructure (note: source: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-energy-transition\_openinfrastructuremap-openstreetmap-osm-activity-7288222806436143105-6aLa/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-energy-transition_openinfrastructuremap-openstreetmap-osm-activity-7288222806436143105-6aLa/) )

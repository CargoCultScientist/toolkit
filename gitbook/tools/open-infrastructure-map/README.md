# Open Infrastructure Map

## URL

[https://openinframap.org](https://openinframap.org)

## Description

Open Infrastructure Map allows users to search for and view global infrastructure networks, to include:

* power lines, power plants, generators, power line supports, switchgear
* telecom
* gas
* petroleum
* water
* other pipelines

The basic purpose of the tool is that infrastructure data is contained within OSM, but not exposed by default, and this tool fills that gap. Users can select and display different layers of infrastructure data at their chosen location on the globe.

### The Interface

The tool presents a globe the user can turn in order to zoom in on a geographical location of interest.  On the sidebar are various types of infrastructure the user can select or deselect.  The sidebar also contains a key with icons and colored lines representing various infrastructure types, which the user can consult to identify the infrastructure being displayed. For example, an icon of a tower denotes a telecom tower; a red line represents a ≥ 220 kV powerline, and so forth. &#x20;

Once the user has zoomed in sufficiently on a location — for example, a power station -- the user can click on it, which opens a mini window containing additional details about the location.&#x20;

The map also provides a selectable "[nighttime lights](https://mapyourgrid.org/tools/)" feature.

Much of the interface functionality is contained in the menu links labelled About, Stats and Export.&#x20;

About: There is good advice under “About” which is about what users do in practice about exporting data – it’s different depending upon the amount of data required.

As shown in the layers menu, the tool is used to filter a number of layers showing different types of infrastructure, as shown in the layers menu, which can be found (at <mark style="color:$warning;">tbd</mark>). &#x20;

<mark style="color:$warning;">tbd</mark>: One point which users need clarifying is what the layer option under Validation called Osmose (Power) is about (because there are separate layers for Power). Google “Osmose” and see what you make of it as validation.

<mark style="color:$warning;">tbd</mark>: We should consider showing graphics on the GUI because its not intuitive, graphics on the Layers because they are important and the menu is small, and the section on power statistics hidden under the “statistics” link, which actually looks quite useful.

<mark style="color:$warning;">to be checked</mark>: I cannot get the search input box on the main page to take co-ordinates for a location, can you? It only seems to take text as input. This is quite an important point for users. Please check.

<mark style="color:$warning;">?</mark> One points about the maps is whether they are the literal paths of the infrastructure, or simply showing a connection between two points, always as the shortest distance. This matters for applications like tracking ship anchor dragging across undersea cables.

&#x20;Because Open Infrastructure Map aids in infrastructure visibility, it could assist in pursuits as varied as researching a country's oil infrastructure (as referenced, for example, in [https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/04/15/what-oil-satellite-technology-and-iraq-can-tell-us-about-pollution/](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2021/04/15/what-oil-satellite-technology-and-iraq-can-tell-us-about-pollution/),  helping companies focused on energy infrastructure planning, or assisting authorities with emergency preparedness, among many other uses.

Example use case: An energy company focused on accelerating the global transition towards 100% renewable energy used Open Infrastructure Map to map and view India's power infrastructure (note: source: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-energy-transition\_openinfrastructuremap-openstreetmap-osm-activity-7288222806436143105-6aLa/](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/open-energy-transition_openinfrastructuremap-openstreetmap-osm-activity-7288222806436143105-6aLa/) )

## Requirements

An internet connection and browser.

## Limitations

Open Infrastructure Map may be incomplete or contain outdated information.

<mark style="color:$warning;">tbd</mark>: Another item under limitations should be the limitations detailed about the power statistics provided under the Statistics link.

## Ethical Considerations

Since data could be used by bad actors to threaten national security, uploading details should be done with care.

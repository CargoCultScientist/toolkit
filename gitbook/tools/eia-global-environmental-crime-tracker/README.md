# EIA Global Environmental Crime Tracker

## URL

[https://eia-international.org/global-environmental-crime-tracker/](https://eia-international.org/global-environmental-crime-tracker/)

## Description

The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) Global Environmental Crime Tracker is a central public database which provides information about different types of international crime. Using publicly available information including government reports, enforcement agency press releases and non-governmental and academic papers, international news coverage and details from partner NGOs, the tracker allows the user to track global trends through tools such as dashboards and maps. The EIA's offices are in the United Kingdom.

The tracker can illustrate smuggling and trafficking hotspots as well as transportation routes.

According to the EIA, the tracker covers criminal activity in [North American, Asia, Africa and Europe](https://eia-international.org/about-us/where-do-we-work/) and has [focused](https://eia-international.org/our-investigations/global-environmental-crime-tracker-2/) on elephants, pangolins, rhinos, tigers, leopards in their Asian range, snow leopards, clouded leopards, the totoaba fish and timber. In April 2022, the tracker was updated to include illegal trade of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) climate-harming gases. The EIA hopes to add other types of environmental crime in the future, as it currently does not cover Latin America, Antarctica or Oceania.

## Requirements

Internet access is required to use the tracker.

## Limitations

The EIA acknowledges it is a small NGO with a limited capacity to collect data. Not all information is available by open-source means and the EIA does not have the resources to contact all law enforcement agencies at the local level. While the EIA tries to fill in gaps wherever possible, it does not have the resources to identify and all seizure and prosecutions.&#x20;

## Ethical Considerations

The EIA acknowledges one of its donors is the UK government through the IWT Challenge Fund, which specifically [supports](https://eia-international.org/global-environmental-crime-tracker/) the EIA's prosecution dashboard.

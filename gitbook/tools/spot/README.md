## Description

Spot provides an interface to Open Street Map, which is a free, open map database of the world, updated and maintained by a community of volunteers via collaborative working. Open Street Map contains the locations of a large number of features such as buildings and infrastructure, e.g. town hall, water, pylon, railway. The Spot user can describe a location search in terms of these features and a given search area, and Spot will return a map showing those candidate groups of features whenever they meet the user's criteria. The location can be described in terms of a large vocabulary of map features, their proximity and their geography. A common OSINV use case involves the user describing an image or video frame which they want to geolocate, and using Spot to generate potential solution locations around a particular geographic region like a named city.

Structure of Spot

Spot works in 3 stages:

1. uses natural language prompts as input,&#x20;
2. converts them into code to perform a search
3. displays the results on a map. Natural language [refers](https://www.ft.com/content/c0c8d205-e158-409e-963c-a3ac821cd7ba?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to human speech or text processed by artificial intelligence, and this process is known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). Spot also supports multiple languages for effective location searches in addition to English.

\
The integration of mapping services like Google, Yandex, and Bing further enhances the tool. Users can also view their location of interest in Google Street View. Collaboration is facilitated by enabling users to save, download, and share their sessions.

\[Need Venn diagram or a hierarchy demonstrating tool to show the issues of categorization, e.g. we want all military bases. If the system has categorized police buildings separately, we will need to search for those separately: they will not be returned within a military bases search. If the system has a hierarchy within which police buildings are a subset of military bases, then police buildings will be returned in a military bases search. This is an important point about categorisations.]

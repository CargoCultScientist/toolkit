## Description

ImportGenius is a paid-for online database of shipping data for countries including the US, Russia and India (see the full list [here](https://www.importgenius.com/how-it-works)). The data is sourced from country governments. It consists of bills of lading, which are legal documents detailing the type, quantity and destination of the goods being transported.    A bill of lading is issued by a carrier (e.g. a shipper) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment ([see more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading)). Fields provided include product description, consignee, shipper and total value.

ImportGenius has a portal where you can create and save searches for specific data. You can also follow companies.

ImportGenius does not have a free search. Some open source researchers might find it worth paying for access as this data is not generally available for free. (It is for the US through [ImportYeti](https://app.gitbook.com/o/WQpOq5ZFue4N6m65QCJq/s/GJyHaCYBR6gnNIW1tHhY/).)

Note that the data provided per country differs, and it is updated at different frequencies per country - so it's worth having a demo before you subscribe. Ask about whether they cover shipping or other modes of transport for the countries in which you are interested.

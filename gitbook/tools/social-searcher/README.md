## Description

Users can search by keyword, source, and content type (link, status, photo, video) but this may vary slightly by platform due to API limitations. It tracks mentions across 11 platforms including: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, Tumblr, Reddit, Flickr, Dailymotion, and VKontakte.&#x20;

The results analyze sentiment, engagement and number of users. It also allows you to explore popular hashtags on Instagram, Twitter and other social networks. It has a feature for monitoring searches, saving search history, and to receive live notifications when a keyword is mentioned (only available in the paid plan).&#x20;

How to Use:

1. Go to [Social Searcher website](https://www.social-searcher.com/).
2. Enter your keyword or hashtag.
3. Choose filters (platform, time, etc.) if needed.
4. View and analyze the results

Each result includes:

* Post preview (with content and author)
* Engagement (likes, comments, shares)
* Sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
* Date and platform source
* Direct link to the original post

The paid plan offers a user dashboard for tracking results over time.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Users can conduct basic searches for free. Additional features require signing up for a free or a [paid account](https://www.social-searcher.com/2014/08/25/social-searcher-now-with-social-monitoring/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The paid plan offers “social monitoring” – which includes saved search history, exporting data, API integration and more advanced tracking including email alerts.

## Requirements

Anything beyond basic searches requires users to sign up with their email to get a free or paid account.

## Limitations

Instagram and Facebook data is more limited than in the past (due to API restrictions), especially for personal accounts.

## Ethical Considerations

Social Searcher only accesses publicly available posts, but users may not always realize their content is being mined for analysis. Informed consent may be required when quoting or analyzing posts from identifiable individuals. Even public posts can carry ethical concerns if the data is used out of context or in ways the poster wouldn’t expect, and special attention needs to be paid to protecting the identities of private citizens, minors, and vulnerable groups.&#x20;

Each social platform (e.g., Twitter/X, Instagram) has its own terms of service regarding scraping, API use, and content reuse, and bypassing these rules could could breach platform terms or even legal boundaries, especially in regions with strong data privacy laws (like GDPR in the EU).

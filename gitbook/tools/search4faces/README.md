## Description

**Search4Faces** is a reverse face search engine that allows users to find the profile photos of individuals across various online platforms. The tool is implemented in Python and is accessible via a web interface or as a Python library. As of June 2025, the tool has (partial) collections of the following [four databases](https://web.archive.org/web/20250616163324/https://search4faces.com/en/):

1. Avatars of the social network Vkontakte and main photos of the social network Odnoklassniki,
2. Profile photos of the social network Vkontakte (VK),&#x20;
3. Avatars of Tiktok users,&#x20;
4. Avatars of ClubHouse users.

The tool also has a search feature for recognizing celebrities which - [according to the tool provider](https://web.archive.org/web/20250616164148/https://search4faces.com/index.html) - is based on Wikipedia and[ IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) data.&#x20;

The site is available in Russian and English. To start a search, users first need to choose a collection. They can then upload the picture of a person of interest.&#x20;

A search for a Donald Trump picture selecting the VK and Odnoassniki avatars collection, for instance, brought up various pictures of Donald Trump that are currently being used (or have been used) by VK users as avatars:

It also provides a name for the person but this name can be wrong (for instance if someone uses the picture of Donald Trump for their own social media account).</p></figcaption></figure>

By clicking on any of the photos in the results list, users are directly brought to the social media profile that featured the picture. Keep in mind that the Search4face database is not updated on a regular basis. The VK or Odnoklassniki accounts might have changed their avatar or they might have been deleted in the meantime.

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

Search features on the site itself are free, but [API access](https://search4faces.com/en/api.html) is paid with multiple plans ranging from 15000 calls for 40 USD to 135000 calls for 320 USD.&#x20;

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

* API can be accessed after purchasing a plan or contacting their team for trial access. The API uses JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol over HTTPS, and you can interact with it using client libraries available for Python and PHP.
* No requirements for using the search features on the site itself. It is not necessary to create an account.

## Limitations

* Since the Search4Face database is limited, it is not able to provide accurate results for many uploaded pictures. Our own tests suggest that in those cases, the search engine appears to compare general characteristics of the provided face (hair, eye or skin color) which does not tend to be helpful for open source researchers.&#x20;
* Image data for each social networking site is not updated in real-time, most datasets end around 2022. Certain user profiles can evade detection by changing their details.&#x20;
* The tool relies on other parameters (such as, age and gender) to improve results, using estimates of the values may limit its accuracy.
* You cannot search multiple databases at once.

## Ethical Considerations

* Persons with similar faces can be misidentified without accounting for other contextual information.
* Results can leak personally identifiable information such as general location, home address or the same of associated persons.

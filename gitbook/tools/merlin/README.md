## Description

Merlin is a bird-identification app with a repository of over 10,000 birds in its system. It has three identification methods:

1. Step by step

Enter characteristics such as the color of the bird and size to find your bird. Merlin offers numerous options depending on location and date. You will get a description of each bird found matching the search terms, sounds and geographic expansion of the birds.

2. Sound ID

You can record birds and Merlin will match them with birds near you based on your location. The sounds you upload are saved in the app with location and time information. The recognition system is good enough to detect the sound of birds even with a little background noise.

3. Photo ID

You can take a photo of your bird or upload an existing one from your gallery. You can also optionally add location and date information. The app will match the image with species in the database.

It is not necessary to create an account to use the application. However, one of the advantages of creating one is that you can create lists of the birds you search for and save them. In addition, Merlin allows downloading data packets based on the location of interest. For example, you can download a Paraguayan birds packet to get more specific results when searching for birds in this country.

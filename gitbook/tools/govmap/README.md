## Description

GovMap was developed by the Israeli government to provide the public with detailed geographical information about Israel. The web-based platform features a wide range of data, including property boundaries, urban planning and zoning information, and infrastructure details like cellular antennas, roads, utilities, and public institutions. It allows users to search, view, and analyze the available geographical data.

According to the [tool](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/topics/research-govmap/govil-landing-page), the map uses “government offices as \[their] data sources” and [is a collaboration project among them with the Survey of Israel as the lead. ](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/topics/research-govmap/govil-landing-page) &#x20;

### Navigating between the English and Hebrew Homepages

For beginner users, note that the Hebrew user interface is slightly different from the English user interface, given the difference in the writing system between the two. Users are immediately taken to the landing page in Hebrew, and they can choose to switch to English on the bottom corner.&#x20;

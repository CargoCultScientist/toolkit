## Description

Global Suppliers Online is a website where suppliers from all over the world promote their goods and contact buyers. If your research is related to companies or individuals engaged in the trade of any goods, you can search for their name and, if they have published their services on this site, obtain relevant details such as addresses, products traded and even a point of contact, such as the name of a person in charge of the trade. You can also discover who is asking for some items or goods you are researching and get contact points, company names and countries involved.

You can search without logging in but you can also create an account to get a buyer membership, which will allow you to keep track of what you see by adding the entries you find useful to the Inquiry Manager. Just click on “Contact this buyer” and it will be saved to your account.

You can also find people requesting certain products, so you can use this tool to search for individuals who are of interest to your research. The commercial staff of a company may differ from those who run it, and the names given here may bring a new perspective to your research. While doing wildlife trade research, I was able to find on this site a business manager's name different from the director's name that appears in official records and in business information search software. This data, although basic, allowed me to turn my research around.

If you are looking for illegal operations, keep in mind that they may also be doing legal deals!

This is especially useful to see what your company/individual is trading in. Company and people names were covered.</p></figcaption></figure>

## Cost

* [ ] Free
* [x] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

You can search this website for free, but there are [subscription](https://www.globalbuyersonline.com/members/joinnow/) options that allow you to go a little further.

Buyer membership (Free)

With this membership you can search and add buying requirements. You have to register by providing your contact information and some company information. You can fill in the required fields to create an account with any information.&#x20;

Trial Membership (Free, but they will review your profile)

After activating your buyer membership, they will review your profile and decide whether or not to grant you this type of membership. You will have access to an inquiry manager: it will monitor new buying needs that may be of interest to you and keep you informed. My trial membership was activated two days after I created my profile and it now sends me recommendations based on my type of business (clothing).

[Basic Membership and Select Membership](https://www.globalbuyersonline.com/members/joinnow/) (120 USD and 260 USD every year each)

If you wish to contact buyers, you will have to pay for one of these memberships. With the basic membership you can contact up to 10 buyers and the select membership allows you unlimited contacts. These memberships allow you to disclose buyers' information (again, 10 buyers with basic and unlimited with select). There are other benefits listed that you can review [here](https://www.globalbuyersonline.com/members/reg.asp) after logging in, but they are not very useful for research purposes.

## Requirements

None, unless you want to contact the suppliers. In that case, you will need to provide data to send an enquiry.

## Limitations

Not every company in the world has posted here. There are many other websites/forums like this to look for this information, such as [go4WorldBusiness](https://www.go4worldbusiness.com/) and [ECPlaza](https://www.ecplaza.net/). But this is a good place to start. Based on the website [estimates](https://www.globalbuyersonline.com/members/joinnow/), the community of buyers and suppliers of this website is around 500,000.

## Ethical Considerations

None so far, unless you decide to engage with the suppliers or post a buy requirement irregularly or contrary to the guidelines of the project/place you are developing/working with.&#x20;

## Guides and articles

None.

## Tool provider

The website says "Internet Trade Services", but I could not find any information on them.

## Limitations

MW Geofind is subjected to the following limitations:

* **API rate limits:** searches are rate limited by YouTube. Rate limits are reset once a day at 9am Pacific time. If users find that the tool does not function, they should check again in the morning of Pacific time.&#x20;
* **Geographical Coverage**: Its effectiveness and accuracy might vary across different geographical locations.
* **Accuracy of location tags:** It is important to independently verify the location of any video that you find via the tool. The provided location might not be correct since Youtube users might add incorrect location information to their videos.

Be aware that the tool is not able to provide all videos that can be found on Youtube from a specific location, it will only provide a selection of videos.

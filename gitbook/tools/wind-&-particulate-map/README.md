## Description

**Nullschool Earth Map** is an interactive, animated visualization of global environmental data. It displays near real-time information on wind, ocean currents, waves, air pollutants and more. Users can explore different data layers, projections and dates to observe environmental conditions across the planet.&#x20;

In addition to viewing global environmental trends, by clicking on a specific location or specifying latitude/longitude coordinates in the URL, users can get interpolated data values of any given metric for a specified location.

To change the date, mode and other metrics, click the "earth" label with the three-line menu icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen.

## Requirements

No special setup is needed. The map works well on mobile devices and is optimized to handle large, graphics-intensive data smoothly. However, performance may be slower on older devices or outdated browsers.

## Limitations

* **Approximate Data Between Grid Points:** The wind, ocean, and atmospheric data is based on a global grid with points spaced about **1° apart** (roughly 111 km at the equator). For any location between these points, the tool **estimates** the data using interpolation — a best-guess method that smooths values but can reduce local accuracy.
* **Configuration Complexity and Inconsistencies:** The site stores your settings (like chosen layer, date, projection and selected point) in the URL itself. While this allows for easy sharing and bookmarking, and specifying exact latitude/longitude, it can sometimes cause strange behavior when switching between layers, leading to temporary glitches that usually quickly fix themselves.
* **Errors Fetching 2013 Data:** The interface allows the user to select dates as far back as January 2013, but for all modes, when a date prior to November 2013 is selected, an error message appears indicating that the data could not be retrieved. Some modes are not able to successfully fetch data until at least 2014.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Do not overstate precision.** The map visualizes model-based, interpolated data. It is not precise at a hyper-local level and should be used as supporting context, not as definitive proof.
* **Use in combination with other sources.** Cross-reference environmental data with satellite imagery, eyewitness reports or local measurements to avoid misinterpretation.
* **Avoid misleading visuals.** Animated wind or pollution overlays can appear dramatic. Be careful not to exaggerate claims or mislead audiences based on the visual effect alone.

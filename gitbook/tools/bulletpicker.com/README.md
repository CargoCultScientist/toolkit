### Key Areas&#x20;

The contents are organized into the following categories, accessible through the navigation menu on the left side of the page.&#x20;

1.[ Library](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_library.html) - This section is a collection of manuals from different armed forces (including historical manuals).

2\. [Fillers](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_explosives.html) - this section contains resources on various fillers, defined as the ["energetic material (propellants, explosives, or pyrotechnic mixes)"](https://www.denix.osd.mil/uxo/explosives-safety/faqs/#faq-1) contained inside military munitions. These are the explosive materials packed inside an ordnance and are the substances that do the job of creating the explosion. Contents are organized in alphabetical order by name of the explosive agent.&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-01_16-03-25.png" alt="" width="277"><figcaption><p>Users can locate the navigation panel to the left of the website. This is a sample of llst of fillers available on the website organized in alphabetical order. </p></figcaption></figure>

3\. [Ordnance](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_ord.html) - This section contains a list of various weapon systems, along with a brief introduction to each system. If you are new to the subject matter, it is recommended to start by exploring the “General Information” tab before moving on to more technical sections.&#x20;

Each type of ordnance has a subcategory organized by country.&#x20;

**For example:**&#x20;

_Ordnance → Bombs → Ukraine_&#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-01_16-02-21.png" alt="" width="195"><figcaption><p>Researchers interested in a praticular kind of ordnance can first navigate to the type of ordnance (Bombs, Clusters, etc) followed by the country it may belong to as seen in this screenshot (Image Credit: Bulletpicker.com) </p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/2025-05-07_17-06-05-guide.png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>(Click to enlarge) This is a quick guide we created for navigating information on various ordinances listed on the website. Note that not all types of ordnance have information on each of these categories. Some do not have images, and some do not have information on how they function or information on hazardous content. </p></figcaption></figure>

4\. [Fuzes](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_fuze.html) -  According to this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuze), a fuze is a “device with explosive components designed to initiate the main charge” and determines when the explosion happens. This section of the website lists various types of fuzes which are categorized by country. Some types contain a short description, an image, a short description of its function, hazardous components, if any, - for example [here](https://www.bulletpicker.com/adapter-booster_-m102a1.html). Also note that sometimes items will contain just a diagram and no real-life photo, or just a real-life photo with no diagram. Sometimes, these items contain both.&#x20;

The content is organized by type of ordnance in which the fuze is used in, and then followed by a subcategory organized by country.&#x20;

**For example:**

_Fuzes → Bombs, Clusters and Dispensers → France_&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}

Based on the disclaimers and the technical nature of the subject matter (Ordnance, Explosives), navigating and understanding the information on Bulletpicker.com might require some prior knowledge or a careful approach. Beginner users without a background in this area should exercise extreme caution and know the site's limitations.

## Requirements

* A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
* PDF Reader

## Limitations

[**The tool’s homepage explicitly states several limitations:**](https://www.bulletpicker.com/index.html)

* The content is not for Demining, Unexploded Ordnance (UXO), or  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) information.
* Not designed to teach EOD/UXO technicians or deminers.
* Not designed to identify UXO or ordnance.
* Content is not for identification or instructional purposes for unqualified individuals.
* Does not replace qualified specialists.
* Users are responsible for verifying content with other official references.
* Bulletpicker, LLC is not associated with the DoD or the US Government.
* Bulletpicker, LLC does not handle classified Government documents or data.
* Proximity to UXO is always dangerous and should be avoided; only trained personnel should handle it.

Based on our review, here are additional limitations:

1. Foundational knowledge required&#x20;

The content of Bulletpicker.com is intended for those with a foundational background on military weapons systems. Beginner users will not find introductory content. It is not designed for beginner users, and assumes they possess foundational knowledge of ordnance terminology and identification.&#x20;

2. Content Variability:&#x20;

Information depth and organization vary across the different sections of the website, possibly due to the reliance on public domain materials and sources with expired copyrights. This creates noticeable inconsistencies in coverage.

For example, [the Ordnance/Bombs subcategory ](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_bombs.html)includes resources for 13 countries, while the [“Clusters and Dispensers” subcategory](https://www.bulletpicker.com/_clusters.html) covers eight countries plus an “unknown” category.&#x20;

It is unclear whether this coverage limitation stems from data availability constraints or reflects the actual global distribution of ordnance manufacturing capabilities. In other words,  is this because these are the only resources publicly available, or is this the list of countries known to produce such types of devices? &#x20;

Another example is that not all items will contain an image or diagram.&#x20;

Users have to be aware that some information may not be available due to security and confidentiality reasons.&#x20;

3. Searching:&#x20;

Many of the resources are PDF documents or images that require opening, which can be time consuming, however, the search and index help to mitigate that.

If the researcher has limited foundational knowledge on the subject matter, this may not be the first resource to use for weapons identification. Users may need to know some technical terms to use the search function effectively and find what they want.&#x20;

Overall, this website is an extremely valuable resource. Users, however, should be mindful of some limitations.&#x20;

[**The tool’s homepage explicitly states several limitations:**](https://www.bulletpicker.com/index.html)

## Description

Requiring no sign up and only a small learning curve, judyrecords offers quick and efficient access to massive amounts of open source legal information for the United States.&#x20;

While anyone can immediately start searching the database of information, the site specific search operators narrow down options considerably and quickly.&#x20;

For example, the search term `jeffrey epstein,, florida` means, "search for the name Jeffrey Epstein with moderate strictness, with the word Florida in the results". To increase or decrease the strictness, one merely needs to add or remove a comma.&#x20;

If the results aren't what was expected, try using the exact phrase proximity operator, which is a tilde \~ with a number immediately after it. As an example, the search term `"jeffrey e epstein" ~3` would read as, "search for Jeffrey E Epstein, and also search for variations of those words and letter, with up to three of those words out of order".

The minus sign, or -, also signals to database "do not search this term", and requires no space between the word and the minus sign. Therefore, `jeffrey e epstein,,, -arrest`  would signal to the database, "search strictly for Jeffrey E Epstein, but exclude any results with the word arrest in them".

`AND`, `OR` and `NOT` work the same as most search engines, in that they designate to search both, either or none of the words immediately after the term. The only difference with judyrecords is that any words that need to stay together require brackets ( ) around them. For example, `(jeffrey epstein,,,) AND (palm beach county)` will serve as a search to find, "strictly find the name Jeffrey Epstein as well as Palm Beach County".&#x20;

If there's an error in the search terms, a popup will instruct you to try again, or try a different search.

## Ethical Considerations

Thought provoking and nuanced discussions about the ethical considerations of a tool usually involve real-world applications. With that in mind, in 2022, Californian closed access legal records were found in the judyrecords database. The person who runs judyrecords shared a comprehensive play-by-play after the issue was resolved in a post titled, "[What Happened With Tyler Technologies](https://www.judyrecords.com/what-happened-with-tyler-technologies)". (Note: strong language used throughout).

All information found at judyrecords needs to be validated; there's no guarantee that the information is 100% accurate.

[Google Scholar Courts](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_courts) also provides US case law searches, where you can break down the court and location prior to searching, if needed.

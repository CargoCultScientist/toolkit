## Description

BskyThreadReader is a web-based tool that enables users to view and share Bluesky threads without requiring a Bluesky account. This tool offers instant access to Bluesky discussions, presenting content in an easy-to-read format. It can be a valuable resource for open-source researchers and journalists who need to monitor conversations on Bluesky without logging in.

## Cost

* [x] Free
* [ ] Partially Free
* [ ] Paid

BskyThreadReader is completely free to use and open-source under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). There are no paid features or subscriptions required.

## Level of difficulty

<table><thead><tr><th data-type="rating" data-max="5"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Requirements

No Bluesky account, API key, or registration is required. The tool runs in any modern web browser with JavaScript enabled and does not require extensions or additional software.

## Limitations

* Read-only access: Users cannot log in, post, or interact with threads; they can only view them.
* No search functionality or filtering beyond viewing a given thread.
* Relies on a third-party service for fetching threads; if that service or Bluesky’s servers are down, the viewer will not function.
* Large or deeply nested threads may be difficult to navigate.

## Ethical Considerations

BskyThreadReader accesses only publicly available data, ensuring compliance with user privacy on Bluesky. However, open-source researchers should:

* Cite and share content responsibly to avoid misrepresentation.
* Consider archiving important threads for verification, as Bluesky posts can be deleted. (There is no turnkey solution to archiving Bluesky threads yet, but you can use [Hunch.ly](https://hunch.ly/) or the [Bluesky API](https://docs.bsky.app/). Searching github for “BlueSky thread archive” or “bsky export” can help you find tools and examples.)
* Be mindful that third-party services could log thread fetches, which may have implications for sensitive investigations.

## Comparison with similar tools

* **Skyview (**[**skyview.social**](https://skyview.social/)**)** offers multiple viewing modes, including a nested tree view and single-post embedding. In contrast to BskyThreadReader, it's fully [open-source](https://github.com/badlogic/skyview).
* **Blueviewer (**[**blueviewer.pages.dev**](https://blueviewer.pages.dev/)**)** is another open-source thread viewer that works across various Bluesky apps. It is lightweight and straightforward but lacks Skyview’s anonymous viewing features.&#x20;
* **Skythread (**[**blue.mackuba.eu**](https://blue.mackuba.eu)**)** focuses on displaying threads in a tree structure, making it better suited for long discussions.

Compared to these alternatives, BskyThreadReader is simple and effective but lacks advanced features such as thread trees and privacy-focused enhancements.

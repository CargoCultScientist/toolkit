## Description

Launched in 2012, the Environmental Justice Atlas (also known as the EJAtlas) is a project based on the work of [hundreds of contributors](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) including from academics, citizens, informal committees, NGOs and other activist groups. The database is meant to be a resource for teaching, networking and advocacy of over 4,300 social conflicts involving environmental issues around the world. It can also be a helpful resource for open source researchers due to its archive of information that can provide history and context for a conflict.

The map covers conflicts across 10 [categories](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) including:&#x20;

* Nuclear
* Mineral Ores and Building Extractions
* Waste Management
* Biomass and Land Conflicts
* Fossil Fuels
* Energy and Climate Justice
* Water Management
* Infrastructure and Built Environment
* Tourism Recreation
* Biodiversity Conservation Conflicts&#x20;
* Industrial and Utilities Conflicts&#x20;

The database contains information including the investors, details about these deals, conflict impacts, project details, outcomes, references to legislation, academic research, videos and images.&#x20;

Open source researchers may find the map useful for these categories or related areas for historical information, links to relevant organizations and source materials and as an overview of specific conflicts. The map can be filtered by multiple types of criteria, including region, start/end date, type of conflict and more. A researcher may also perform searches such as entering the word "gas," and the search results will include any entry that uses the word "gas" in the text.

Depending on the entry, the information may be available in languages including English, French, Italian, Chinese, Arabic, or Turkish. Not all entries will be available in multiple languages.&#x20;

According to the site's [FAQ](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/), a user is free to use the database for noncommercial purposes only, with attribution given to the EJAtlas with a link to its homepage.

## Limitations

In its [FAQ](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/), EJAtlas specifically acknowledges that there are limitations to the data, including the availability of information, the changing nature of the situation on the ground, the time constraints of the contributors and volunteers plus when there are inter-group conflicts such as conservation activities clash with local communities. This includes entries that may be only available in English. The FAQ also addresses issues of data quality, and states all of its data is "based and derived from secondary sources" and that it makes an effort to verify this information is from "trusted publications."

EJAtlas [describes](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) itself as a "an archive of socioecological resistances."

## Ethical Considerations

None.

## Guide

While not a guide, the site's [FAQ](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) can be helpful for context and background information.

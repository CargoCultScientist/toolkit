## Description

Launched in 2012, the Environmental Justice Atlas (also known as the EJAtlas) is a project based on the work of [hundreds of contributors](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) including from academics, citizens, informal committees, NGOs and other activist groups. The database is meant to be a resource for teaching, networking and advocacy of over 4,300 social conflicts involving environmental issues around the world. It can also be a helpful resource for open source researchers due to its archive of information that can provide history and context for a conflict.

The map covers conflicts across 10 categories including: nuclear, mineral ores and building extractions, waste management, biomass and land conflicts, fossil fuels, energy and climate justice, water management, infrastructure and built environment, tourism recreation, biodiversity conservation conflicts and industrial and utilities conflicts. The database contains information including the investors, details about these deals, conflict impacts, project details, outcomes, references to legislation, academic research, videos and images.

## Limitations

EJAtlas acknowledges that there are limitations to the data, including the availability of information, the changing nature of the situation on the ground, the time constraints of the contributors and volunteers plus when contextualization comes in conflict such as when conservation activities clash with local communities. EJAtlas [describes](https://ejatlas.org/backoffice/cms/en/faq/) itself as a "an archive of socioecological resistances."

## Ethical Considerations

None.

## Guide

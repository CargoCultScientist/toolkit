# Resource Watch

## URL

[https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore](https://resourcewatch.org/)

## Description

Uses geospatial data from satellites, ground sensors and web scraping to provide insights on topics such as climate change, poverty, water risk, state instability, air pollution and human migration.

It allows a user to explore and overlay different datasets and also to create custom dashboards based on oneâ€™s specific area of research.

Datasets are sourced from governments, intergovernmental organizations, research institutions, and scientific publications.

Some data are updated every hour, every 12 hours, monthly, annually, and some less frequently. There is the possibility to sign up for alerts every time a dataset is updated.

It has an open-source API which lets developers build customized tools. For example, it has informed offshoot thematic data initiatives such as [Ocean Watch](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2021/11/29/how-listening-to-a-sea-of-voices-can-transform-ocean-management/) and [Land & Carbon Lab](https://dobecology.foleon.com/go/4-optimism-in-times-of-crises/wri-resource-watch/#block-100185753).

Data from Resource Watch has been used for example, for:

* [monitoring tree cover loss and fires ](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2019/04/11/how-resource-watch-changed-the-way-we-monitor-the-planets-pulse/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)within protected areas
* [providing data on environmental trends](https://blog.resourcewatch.org/2019/04/11/how-resource-watch-changed-the-way-we-monitor-the-planets-pulse/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and risks to financial institutions
* informing early warning systems for local officials in predicting when water stress can influence conflict and political instability before it spreads through the [Water, Peace and Security (WPS) initiative](https://www.un-ihe.org/news/water-peace-and-security-initiative)

## Requirements

Some familiarity with using large datasets will be necessary. A basic understanding of geospatial mapping techniques is desirable.  &#x20;

## Limitations

The tool is still currently in Beta mode and there may be bugs or errors.

Using the available may be more useful and time-efficient if the researcher has a pre-specified area of investigation set out before accessing the database.&#x20;

Overlaying different datasets can help uncover new patterns of areas of research but this will require more time investment by the researcher.

A caveat is that correlations or patterns do not imply causation.&#x20;

It is also important to ensure that the time frame and spatial scales for the overlayed datasets are compatible before analyzing the data or drawing conclusions.

## Ethical Considerations

The platform is convened and hosted by the non-profit research organization World Resources Institute (WRI) with over 30 partners that include universities, private and public organizations as well as international organizations and the UN.

Data is [independently verified](https://resourcewatch.org/about/faqs) through WRI which works through its partners for peer review and quality assurance.&#x20;
